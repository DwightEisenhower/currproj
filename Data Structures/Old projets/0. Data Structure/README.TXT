Big O Complexity

O(1) - Constant Time
O(log(n)) - Logarithmic Time
O(n) - Linear Time
O(nlog(n)) - Quasilinear Time
O(n^2) - Quadratic Time
O(2^n) - Exponential Time
O(n!) - Factorial Time

Expect worst time
Once in a while expensive calcs don't count
Ignore constants
Only the biggest term is important
When in doubt, bound bigger
