A mean, grouchy, old history teacher needs to create a quiz on state capitals. This quiz has 50 questions
on it and asks a multiple-choice question about each state's capital. Each question contains one
right answer and three wrong answers randomly selected from all the state capitals.

A question looks as follows:

01. What is the capital of New Jersey?
(a) Trenton
(b) Salt Lake City
(c) Montgomery
(d) Albany
